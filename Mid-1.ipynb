In the cases of both `reverse = False` and `reverse = True`, the time complexity is identically $O(log(n))$.\n",

    "The utilized `quick sort` algorithm is the traditional one. Most of all, let a value of `lst[0]` be in good pivot range, which exclude the values too near to side, (which learned in the class) and the probability is  $p,$ $where$  $0 < p < 1$ . And, let's assume that there is only one element at i-th depth node. Then, there are expected to be the number of $ip$ good pivot if partitioning is progressed $i$ times. After the partitionings, the number of the elements in $i$-th node can be expressed mathematically like the following equation: $(\\frac{1+p}{2})^{ip}n$. Therefore, I could complete the following equation: $(\\frac{1+p}{2})^{ip}n = 1$. Thus, $i$ is $i = \\frac{1}{p} log_{\\frac{2}{1+p}}n$. Thus, the Big-O notation of partitioning is $O(log(n))$. And, comparing pivot with every element should be performed $n$-times every node so that this time complexity is $O(n)$.\n",
