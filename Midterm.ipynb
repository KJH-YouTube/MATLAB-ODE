    "#### ANSWER:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that the best-case of the quick sort is choosing the pivot as a value of the middle index. For example, if `lst` is a list of size $n$, then the pivot is `lst[n//2]`, which `n//2` means taking only quotient values. In every partitioning, it needs to compare all elements with the **pivot** value so that this growth rate is $n$. And, let the partitioning depth be $i$. Then, Quick Sort algorithm should partition the list until $\\left ( \\frac{1}{2} \\right )^{i} n$ elements remain about the given list. That's because of letting the partitioned piece have size less than 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the depth $i$ will be like:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\left ( \\frac{1}{2} \\right )^{i}n = 1 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ i = log_{2}{n} = log(n) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "And, going down up to $i-th$ depth, the comparison should be operated every depth. Thus, the growth rate $f(n)$ is $nlog(n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the meantime, this growth rate satisfies the following relation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f(n) = n\\log{n} \\geq c \\cdot n\\log(n)  \\;\\;\\;\\; (\\; s.t \\;\\; c > 0 \\;\\; \\cap \\;\\; n \\geq n_{0} \\;\\; \\cap \\;\\; n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\;) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "And, integer constants $c$ which satisfies the above relation exist at least one.\n",

    "About the quick select algorithm, the worst-case is the case choosing the pivot as a minimum or maximum value every partition step and the $k$ as a maximum or minimum sequential value. In the meantime, it is the case that the wanted value is placed in the long partition. In other words, the worst case happens when the given list is the *sorted list*. For example, the worst-case includes a case of the following figure.\n",
